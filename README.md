Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive business performance analysis project. The project involves analyzing a one-year dataset using Python to identify trends, patterns, and key insights. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize the findings.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis spans one year and includes various metrics related to business performance. It includes data such as sales figures, customer demographics, product performance, and more.

Analysis
The analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques, we uncovered valuable insights into the business's performance over the past year.

Key Findings
Identified seasonal trends in sales data
Highlighted top-performing products and customer segments
Uncovered potential areas for improvement in operational efficiency

Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was created to visually represent the findings of the analysis. The dashboard provides an interactive and intuitive way to explore the data and gain insights at a glance.
